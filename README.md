# AI-Vuln-Scanner

**AI-Vuln-Scanner** is a Python-based, AI-integrated vulnerability scanner that combines the power of Nmap (via `python3-nmap`), multiple leading AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Replit AI, and AnythingLLM), and modern reporting. It performs advanced network scans, then uses AI to analyze results, prioritize risks, and suggest remediations with references to security standards (OWASP ASVS, WSTG, CAPEC, CWE).

---

## Key Features

- **Multiple AI Providers:** Supports OpenAI (GPT-4o), Anthropic Claude, Replit AI, and AnythingLLM. User can select provider and model at runtime.
- **Asset Context & Threat Intelligence:** User can provide or auto-deduce asset type and threat intelligence for more relevant analysis.
- **Scan Profiles:** Eight built-in scan profiles (e.g., Fast, Full, WAF bypass, Vulnerability scan).
- **Rich Output:** Exports to HTML, CSV, XML, TXT, or JSON.
- **Risk Prioritization & Remediation:** AI provides severity, rationale, and actionable remediation for each finding.
- **Debug Mode:** Use `-d` to see detailed debug logs and scan commands.
- **Root Privilege Check:** Warns if root is required for selected scan profile.
- **Interactive & Scriptable:** All options can be provided via command line or interactively.

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.x**  
   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Clone this repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/davidfortytwo/AI-Vuln-Scanner.git
    cd AI-Vuln-Scanner
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Configure your `.env` file:**  
   Copy `.env-example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys as needed:

    ```
    cp .env-example .env
    # Edit .env with your keys and endpoints
    ```

---

## Configuration

**.env-example:**
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  
  ANYTHINGLLM_API_KEY=your_anythingllm_api_key
  
  ANYTHINGLLM_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/v1
  
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
  
  REPLIT_API_KEY=your_replit_api_key
  
  REPLIT_API_URL=https://chat.replit.com/v1/chat/completions
  ```

- Set only the providers you want to use.  
- If multiple are set, youâ€™ll be prompted to choose at runtime.

## Usage

### Basic Example

  python vulnscanner.py -t target_ip_or_hostname -o output_format


- `-t` Target IP or hostname (required)
- `-o` Output format: html, csv, xml, txt, or json (default: html)
- `-p` Scan profile number (see below)
- `-d` Enable debug mode (verbose output)

### Example: Fast Scan with OpenAI
  ```
  python vulnscanner.py -t 192.168.1.1 -o html -p 1
  ```

### Example: WAF Bypass Scan (requires root)

  ```
  sudo python vulnscanner.py -t example.com -o html -p 7
  ```

### Example: Debug Mode
  ```
  python vulnscanner.py -t 192.168.1.1 -o json -p 2 -d
  ```

### Example: Using Anthropic Claude

Set your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` and run:

  ```
  python vulnscanner.py -t 192.168.1.1 -o html -p 2
  ```
Select "Anthropic" when prompted for AI provider


### Example: Using AnythingLLM

Set `ANYTHINGLLM_API_KEY` and `ANYTHINGLLM_API_URL` in `.env` and run:

  ```
  python vulnscanner.py -t 192.168.1.1 -o html -p 2
  ```

Select "AnythingLLM" and then select the desired model when prompted

## Scan Profiles

You can select from the following scan profiles (shown in help and at runtime):

1. Fast scan  
2. Comprehensive scan  
3. Stealth scan with UDP  
4. Full port range scan  
5. Stealth and UDP scan with version detection and OS detection  
6. Vulnerability scan against all TCP and UDP ports  
7. WAF bypass scan against all TCP ports (requires root)  
8. Misconfigured firewall bypass (requires root)  

---

## Asset Context & Threat Intelligence

- You will be prompted to specify the asset type (e.g., "web server", "IoT device") and any current threat intelligence (e.g., "CVE-2025-1234 is being exploited").
- If left blank, the script will auto-deduce/enrich this information based on scan results and common ports.

---

## Output

- Results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a timestamped file in your chosen format.
- Each finding includes:  
  - Vulnerability description  
  - Affected endpoint  
  - Evidence  
  - Severity rating and rationale  
  - Remediation steps  
  - References to OWASP ASVS, WSTG, CAPEC, and CWE (as clickable links)  
  - Risk prioritization and exploitation status

---

## Debug Mode

Add `-d` to any command to enable debug output.  
This will show:
- The actual nmap command being run
- All intermediate data (scan results, AI prompts, etc.)
- API provider/model selection and responses

---

## Multi-AI Support

The scanner supports:
- **OpenAI (GPT-4o and compatible)**
- **AnythingLLM** (self-hosted, supports many models)
- **Anthropic Claude**
- **Replit AI**

You can set up one or more providers in your `.env` file and select at runtime.
